# Image-Classification-using-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The model is trained to extract meaningful spatial features from images and predict the correct class label.
